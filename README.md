Hide text in image

Hide and read message in image. First you open an image, then you choose between hide and read options and enter the original image name. If you choosed hide (H) just enter the text
you want to hide and the output image with it's format (for example "output.png"). If you choosed read (R) just enter the original image name and the second image that you want to read
from. Then this program will find the difference between the two pirctures and will show you the hidden image.
